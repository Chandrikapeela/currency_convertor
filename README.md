## Code Explanation

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the currency converter interface.
  - `input` for entering the amount.
  - `select` elements for choosing currencies.
  - `button` to trigger the conversion.
  - `div` to display the result.

- **CSS**: (In `style.css`) Used for styling the user interface. Customize this file to change the appearance of the application.

- **JavaScript**: (In `script.js`) Handles the conversion logic. Implement the conversion functionality in this file.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a brief example of how the conversion might be implemented in `script.js`:

```javascript
function convert() {
    const amount = document.getElementById('amount').value;
    const fromCurrency = document.getElementById('fromCurrency').value;
    const toCurrency = document.getElementById('toCurrency').value;
    
    // Example conversion rates
    const rates = {
        'USD': 1,
        'EUR': 0.85,
        'INR': 82.73,
        'KRW': 1335.20,
        'JPY': 148.23,
        'CNY': 7.19
    };
    
    const result = (amount * rates[toCurrency] / rates[fromCurrency]).toFixed(2);
    document.getElementById('result').innerText = `${amount} ${fromCurrency} = ${result} ${toCurrency}`;
}
```



**Note:** For real-world applications, you would typically fetch live exchange rates from an API instead of using static rates.
